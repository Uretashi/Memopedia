# Memopedia - Front

Memopedia is an application that allows users to create and log into an account, search some memes (image/video) and post some new one's !


## Dependencies installation

We recommend using yarn package manager to install dependencies and start the React server itself.

### Step's to install yarn and dependencies :

* `npm install --global yarn` (install yarn into the system)
* `yarn -v` (check if yarn was successfully installed)
* `yarn install` (dependencies installation)


#### To install dependencies without yarn, type

* `npm install`

## Start the server

**yarn** - `yarn start`\
**npm** - `npm start`

After, you can go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view Memopedia in your browser !
